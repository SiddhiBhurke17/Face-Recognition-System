# Face-Recognition-System
 ### Face Detection
  - Utilized Open CV and Harcascade frontal face classifier to detect the faces from the image
  - Enabled precise frontal face detection under 700 milliseconds.
 ### Face Recognition
  - Implemented the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) classification algorithm for face recognition.
  - Achieved an outstanding error rate below 3% on a dataset comprising 1,000 images.
